## Overview

Low-Level Design (LLD) is the practice of **component-level software design** — translating high-level architectural decisions into concrete class structures, object relationships, design patterns, and maintainable code.

Where High-Level Design answers _"What are we building?"_, LLD answers _"How exactly do we build it?"_

This repository is a self-contained roadmap that covers foundational OOP principles, all major Gang of Four design patterns, and a curated set of real-world system design problems commonly asked in engineering interviews at product-based companies.

## Learning Process

### How to Use This Roadmap

This repository is designed as a **progressive, hands-on learning path**. Follow these principles:

#### 1. **Learn in Phase Order**
Complete phases sequentially. Each phase builds upon the previous one:
- **Phase 1** establishes the mental models needed for design
- **Phase 2** teaches reusable patterns built on strong foundations
- **Phase 3** applies patterns to realistic scenarios
- **Phase 4** bridges component design with production engineering

#### 2. **Understand Before Implementing**
For each topic:
1. Read the concept explanation
2. Study the provided diagrams and examples
3. Understand the trade-offs and when to use it
4. Then implement from scratch (without looking at reference code initially)

#### 3. **Code-First Learning**
- **Do not just read**. Write code for every pattern and problem
- Implement in your chosen language (Java, Python, or C++)
- Create unit tests to validate your implementation
- Refactor and optimize after it works

#### 4. **Real-World Context**
Connect theory to practice:
- For Phase 3 problems, start with requirements, not code
- Draw a class diagram before coding
- Identify which patterns apply and why
- Discuss trade-offs with peers or in design reviews

## Roadmap


### Phase 1 — Foundations

Build a solid base in object-oriented thinking and modeling before moving to patterns or problems.

| Topic            | Description                                                          | Status |

| UML Diagrams     | Class, Sequence, Activity, and Use-case diagrams                     | [ ]    |
| Object Modeling  | Identifying classes, attributes, and relationships from requirements | [ ]    |

---

### Phase 2 — Design Patterns

Based on the Gang of Four (GoF) catalog. Each pattern includes intent, structure, and a coded example.

#### Creational Patterns

| Pattern          | Intent                                                                              | Status |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Singleton        | Guarantee a single instance across the application                                  | [ ]    |
| Factory Method   | Delegate instantiation to subclasses                                                | [ ]    |
| Abstract Factory | Create families of related objects without specifying concrete classes              | [ ]    |
| Builder          | Construct complex objects step by step, separating construction from representation | [ ]    |
| Prototype        | Create new objects by cloning an existing instance                                  | [ ]    |

#### Structural Patterns

| Pattern   | Intent                                                                   | Status |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Adapter   | Convert one interface into another that clients expect                   | [ ]    |
| Decorator | Attach additional responsibilities to objects dynamically                | [ ]    |
| Facade    | Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem                    | [ ]    |
| Composite | Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies | [ ]    |
| Proxy     | Control access to another object through a surrogate                     | [ ]    |

#### Behavioral Patterns

| Pattern                 | Intent                                                                      | Status |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Observer                | Define a one-to-many dependency so dependents update automatically          | [ ]    |
| Strategy                | Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable at runtime      | [ ]    |
| Command                 | Encapsulate a request as an object for parameterization and queuing         | [ ]    |
| State                   | Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes       | [ ]    |
| Iterator                | Access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its structure | [ ]    |
| Chain of Responsibility | Pass a request along a chain of handlers until one handles it               | [ ]    |
