## Overview

Low-Level Design (LLD) is the practice of **component-level software design** — translating high-level architectural decisions into concrete class structures, object relationships, design patterns, and maintainable code.

Where High-Level Design answers _"What are we building?"_, LLD answers _"How exactly do we build it?"_

This repository is a self-contained roadmap that covers foundational OOP principles, all major Gang of Four design patterns, and a curated set of real-world system design problems commonly asked in engineering interviews at product-based companies.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Foundations

Build a solid base in object-oriented thinking and modeling before moving to patterns or problems.

| Topic            | Description                                                          | Status |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| OOP Principles   | Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism                | [ ]    |
| SOLID Principles | SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP with examples                                | [ ]    |
| UML Diagrams     | Class, Sequence, Activity, and Use-case diagrams                     | [ ]    |
| Object Modeling  | Identifying classes, attributes, and relationships from requirements | [ ]    |

### Phase 2 — Design Patterns

Based on the Gang of Four (GoF) catalog. Each pattern includes intent, structure, and a coded example.

#### Creational Patterns

| Pattern          | Intent                                                                              | Status |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Singleton        | Guarantee a single instance across the application                                  | [ ]    |
| Factory Method   | Delegate instantiation to subclasses                                                | [ ]    |
| Abstract Factory | Create families of related objects without specifying concrete classes              | [ ]    |
| Builder          | Construct complex objects step by step, separating construction from representation | [ ]    |
| Prototype        | Create new objects by cloning an existing instance                                  | [ ]    |

#### Structural Patterns

| Pattern   | Intent                                                                   | Status |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Adapter   | Convert one interface into another that clients expect                   | [ ]    |
| Decorator | Attach additional responsibilities to objects dynamically                | [ ]    |
| Facade    | Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem                    | [ ]    |
| Composite | Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies | [ ]    |
| Proxy     | Control access to another object through a surrogate                     | [ ]    |

#### Behavioral Patterns

| Pattern                 | Intent                                                                      | Status |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Observer                | Define a one-to-many dependency so dependents update automatically          | [ ]    |
| Strategy                | Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable at runtime      | [ ]    |
| Command                 | Encapsulate a request as an object for parameterization and queuing         | [ ]    |
| State                   | Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes       | [ ]    |
| Iterator                | Access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its structure | [ ]    |
| Chain of Responsibility | Pass a request along a chain of handlers until one handles it               | [ ]    |
